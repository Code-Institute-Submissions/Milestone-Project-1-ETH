                            Ethereum is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain" target="_blank">blockchain</a>
                            based network which can be used to create decentralized apps. The Ethereum token is Ether -
                            the cryptocoin which fuels the
                            Ethereum network. Ethereum’s USP lies in the fact that is not used only for digital
                            currency
                            transactions, it can also be used to create massively decentralised contracts and
                            applications.

                        <h3><strong><em>Blockchain </em></strong></h3>
                        <p>
                            means that the currency is built and secured by adding and verifying blocks of
                            transactions(Mining) to blocks made previously,
                            thus forming a "chain". Blocks added to the chain become harder and harder to crack over
                            time,
                            as they are verified by more nodes in the blockchain peer-to-peer network.

                        <p>
                            A decentralized application (Dapp, dApp or DApp) is an application that is run by many
                            users on a decentralized network with
                            trustless protocols. They are designed to avoid any single point of failure. They typically
                            have
                            tokens to reward users for providing computing power.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The definition of a decentralized application is still in development and under debate. The
                            term traces its origins to Decentralized
                            Application Corporation and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization)"

                            Decentralized applications run on top of other cryptographic systems such as Ethereum. Due
                            to blockchain's ubiquitous nature,
                            the high transaction volume of popular DApps can clog the network which leads to slower
                            transaction
                            times and inflated fees; in December of 2017, the popular game <a href="https://www.cryptokitties.co/"
                                target="_blank">CryptoKitties</a> slowed the Ethereum network
                            and exposed the vulnerability of public blockchains to traffic slowdowns, to see all

                        <h3>Advantages</h3>
                        <h4>Higher level of security</h4>
                        <p>
                            The nature of Dapps provides for a higher level of overall security. Since the information
                            is stored on a distributed ledger,
                            a potential threat would have to go through the burden of hacking all of the connected
                            nodes.
                            This addresses popular attacks such as <a href="https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/D/DDoS_attack.html"
                                target="_blank">distributed denial of service (DDoS)</a> . The nature of
                            decentralization itself
                            bars collusion and infiltration, making Dapps a whole lot harder to hack.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Enhanced transparency</h4>
                        <p>
                            Since Dapps run on blockchain, transactions that take place in it are easily verifiable.
                            Everyone can access the record and
                            check the status of current and previous transactions. This transparency also allows for
                            precise
                            verification of all the executed amendments to the code.
