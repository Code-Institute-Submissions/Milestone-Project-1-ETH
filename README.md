# Ethereum | Eco-system Overview
![ethereum logo](https://john-e5.github.io/Milestone-Project-1-ETH/assets/images/main-img.png) 


This Website was developed for Code Institute's User Centic Front End Development Project 1 and is based on the **Ethereum Blockchain App Platform**.
It's a one page website that gives a brief overview of the ethereum eco-system and related services.



 
## UX
I decided to develop this website with a focus on new users to ethereum and blockchain technology and also focus on existing users looking to find more information on the ethereum eco-system.
 

### Topic's include:
1. _Ethereum_
2. _Blockchain_
3. _Smart Contracts_
4. _Decentralized Applications_
5. _Mining_

In the initial stages of development the 5 planes of activity were used to design a user focused one page website with simple navigation and a brief overview of related topics with relevent external linking used to expand on topics and provide valuable resources for the user.

### Style:
The color pallette I chose came from the offical [https://john-e5.github.io/Milestone-Project-1-ETH/Docs/Ethereum_Visual_Identity_1.0.0.pdf](Ethereum visual identity guidelines)


### User Stories:
- As a new user to ethereum and blockchain technology, I want to find infomation on what ethereum is about and how it works.

- As an existing user, I want to source information on ethereum and learn more about smart contracts and decentralized apps and see the current price of ethereum, find and download a wallet.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
